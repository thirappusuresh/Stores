		<P><b>4.
		Visibility of
		your Profile
		to Non-Members
		of KENIZEN</b></P>
		<P>Your
		profile is preset to be invisible to non-members of KENIZEN and not
		traceable by search engines on the Internet. You can, of course,
		adjust these settings at any time. However, please note that if you
		do release your profile to non-members or search engines, this will
		automatically mean that the following sections of your registration
		data are displayed to non-members of KENIZEN: First name, last name,
		state and city of your University or Company</P>
		<P>If
		your profile shall be visible to non-members of KENIZEN or traceable
		by search engines on the Internet, such voluntary data that you have
		specified in the settings under &quot;Privacy&quot; to be visible to
		other KENIZEN members will also automatically be visible to
		non-members of KENIZEN. 
		</P>
		<P>KENIZEN
		may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve
		advertisements on the KENIZEN site. These third-party ad servers or
		ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the
		advertisements and links that appear on KENIZEN. They automatically
		receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other
		technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure
		the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the
		advertising content. KENIZEN does not provide any personally
		identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad
		networks without your consent. However, please note that if an
		advertiser asks KENIZEN to show an advertisement to a certain
		audience and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or
		ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience
		they are trying to reach. The KENIZEN privacy policy does not apply
		to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers,
		third-party ad servers or ad networks. Please consult the respective
		privacy policies of such advertisers third-party ad servers or ad
		networks for more information.</P>
		<P><b>5.
		Groups</b></P>
		<P>On
		the KENIZEN Websites, KENIZEN offers certain groups, forums and
		similar services.</P>
		<P>Each
		group has one (1) or more moderator(s). The moderator decides for
		each group whether the group is public or whether it is only
		accessible to a specific group of people, as well as who has read
		and/or write access for each relevant group. This information will be
		displayed on the KENIZEN Websites for the relevant group. It is
		visible to KENIZEN Members and it may also be visible to non-members
		of KENIZEN, depending on the settings chosen by the moderator.</P>
		<P>Please
		note: where a group is specified as &quot;public&quot; on the KENIZEN
		Website and in the event that the moderator has not restricted the
		access rights to the group, all contributions of KENIZEN Members to
		such a group can be read by all other KENIZEN Members, and these
		contributions are then also accessible to non-members of KENIZEN on
		the Internet without any restrictions. You may deactivate the
		traceability of your contributions to a group by Internet search
		engines or by so-called RSS readers in your privacy settings under
		&quot;Privacy&quot;. However, any contributions you posted on the
		group prior to deactivation will remain visible after the
		deactivation as well. RSS readers are programs which trace updates of
		a website, providing the website technically supports the so called
		RSS standard. Where Internet groups support the RSS standard, the RSS
		reader may track if, when and which new articles have been published.</P>
		<P><b>6.
		Appointments, Activities,
		Event Management</b></P>
		<P>On
		the KENIZEN Websites, KENIZEN offers you the possibility to enter
		your appointments, activities and events as well as similar services
		(collectively hereinafter referred to as &quot;events&quot;). With
		this function you may manage and coordinate your events with other
		KENIZEN Members and/or with non-members of KENIZEN, and you may also
		invite other KENIZEN Members and/or non-members to specific events.</P>
		<P>Each
		event has one (1) or more hosts (organizers). The host decides for
		each event if and which information about the event is visible to
		other KENIZEN Members and/or for non-members of KENIZEN. Among other
		things, this information may include whether the event is reserved to
		KENIZEN Members or whether it is a public event and as such
		accessible to non-members, whether the number of participants is
		limited, whether the guest list is visible without any restrictions
		or if and which restrictions should apply to the visibility of the
		guest list. The above information shall be displayed on the KENIZEN
		Websites for the relevant event. It is visible to KENIZEN Members,
		and it may also be visible to non-members, depending on the settings
		chosen by the host.</P>
		<P><b>7.
		Invitations</b></P>
		<P>As
		a KENIZEN Member you may invite others to join KENIZEN. KENIZEN shall
		process personal data collected in the course of the invitation on
		behalf of the KENIZEN member solely for expanding their network, e.g.
		through contact suggestions, and shall not use it for any other
		purposes.</P>
		<P>KENIZEN
		will send a reminder email (&quot;automatic reminder&quot;) on behalf
		of the KENIZEN member to the recipient of the invitation 21 days
		after you send the invitation. You can deactivate the automatic
		reminder feature in your settings. You are also able to send out
		manual reminder emails in addition to the automatic reminder feature.
		KENIZEN only saves encrypted copies of the email addresses to which
		you send invitations. This encryption is removed temporarily when you
		view these email addresses in your KENIZEN account. You can delete
		the data in your account at any time. Invitation recipients have the
		right to revoke the use of their email address for invitation
		purposes at any time.</P>
		<P>Please
		note that the following sections of your Personal Data are displayed
		to the recipient of the invitation:</P>
		<UL>
			<LI><P>Your name</P>
			<LI><P>Your university /
			company name</P>

		<P><b>8.
		Search Functions</b></P>
		<P>The
		KENIZEN Services offer various possibilities to search for particular
		KENIZEN Members, including a Powersearch feature and a Search Agent
		feature. These various search functions may assist you, for example,
		in finding other KENIZEN Members with similar interests. The search
		functions can also help you to initiate contact with other KENIZEN
		Members who offer exactly what you are looking for. Thus, you can
		find the contacts you need - and systematically expand your personal
		network.</P>
		<P><b>9.
		Cookies and
		pixels</b></P>
		<P>&quot;Cookies&quot;
		are small files that enable us to store specific information related
		to you, the User, on your PC or other end device while using the
		KENIZEN services. Cookies help to analyze usage frequency, the number
		of people who use our website, user behavior on our website,
		advertising effectiveness, and to increased security and tailor our
		service offering to your needs.</P>
		<P>After
		you have logged in to the KENIZEN Services with your username and
		password, KENIZEN uses so-called &quot;session cookies&quot; in order
		to identify you during the course of your session. Upon the
		termination of your session, the session cookie will be automatically
		deleted. You can save session cookies on your computer to enable
		automatic login for subsequent sessions by activating the function:
		&quot;Login automatically on this computer&quot;. Session cookies
		will then store parts of your login data in encrypted form. If you
		select automatic login, please be aware that this will then only be
		possible on the same computer on which the cookie was first saved,
		i.e. an automatic login on two (2) different computers is not
		possible.</P>
		<P>KENIZEN
		Services also use &quot;permanent cookies&quot; to record information
		about visitors to the KENIZEN Websites who repeatedly use the KENIZEN
		Services. Permanent cookies are designed to help us continually
		improve the products and services we offer you. Permanent cookies do
		not contain personal information such as your name, IP address, etc.,
		meaning that we do not generate profiles based on user behavior.</P>
		<P>You
		can edit the settings of your browser to prevent cookies from being
		stored, to limit the storage of cookies to certain websites, or such
		that your browser informs you every time a cookie is sent. You can
		also delete cookies from your PC’s hard drive at any time. However,
		please note that you will not be able to take advantage of the
		KENIZEN Services if session cookies are deactivated.</P>
		<P>Third-party
		cookies could also be stored on your PC or end device when using
		KENIZEN and/or KENIZEN applications which are partially or entirely
		provided by third parties. You can prevent such cookies from being
		stored in your browser by adjusting the browser settings accordingly.</P>
		<P>KENIZEN
		uses so-called pixels, Web beacons, clear GIFs and other similar
		mechanisms (&quot;Pixels&quot;). A pixel is an image file or link to
		an image file added to the Website code but not sent to your end
		device (e.g. PC, smartphone, etc.). Pixels are largely used for the
		same reasons as cookies, i.e. to analyze the number of people who use
		our website or, if the user's email program allows HTML, to determine
		whether and when an email was opened. Pixels help us to check and
		optimize the effectiveness of our Websites, offers and advertising
		campaigns. Pixels do not provide us with personal information and do
		not enable us to track users. Pixels are usually used in conjunction
		with cookies. If you have deactivated the use of cookies in your
		browser, then the pixel will only report an anonymous website visit.</P>
		<P><b>10.
		Log Files/Mobile
		Handshake</b></P>
		<P>Each
		time you access a website from the KENIZEN Websites, KENIZEN will
		save the following data in a log file (the so called &quot;server
		log&quot;):</P>
		<UL>
			<LI><P>The time, status,
			and amount of the transferred data, as well as the website from
			which you have reached the requested page of the KENIZEN Websites
			(the so-called &quot;referrer&quot;)</P>
			<LI><P>The product and
			release information from your Internet browser (the so called &quot;user
			agent&quot;).</P>
		</UL>
		<P>This
		log file will be stored by KENIZEN in the standardized &quot;combined&quot;
		log file format for the Apache web server. KENIZEN will not store
		your IP address once you leave the KENIZEN Websites. Except for
		legislation regarding the storage of data, Users’ IP addresses will
		be deleted or anonymized once they end their session on the KENIZEN
		Websites. Anonymization means that IP addresses are modified in such
		a way that specific personal and/or factual information cannot be
		attributed to a certain identified or identifiable person or can only
		be attributed by deploying a disproportionately large amount of time,
		effort and cost.</P>
		<P>KENIZEN
		uses the data from this log file in anonymous form without reference
		to your person for statistical purposes. In doing so, KENIZEN may
		analyze on which days and at which time the KENIZEN Websites are
		particularly frequented and how much data volume is created on the
		KENIZEN Websites. Furthermore, by using the log file, KENIZEN can
		identify defects on the KENIZEN Websites, such as defective
		hyperlinks or program defects, and thus continually improve the
		quality of the KENIZEN Websites. KENIZEN does not attribute the
		website demands stored in the log file to specific individual users.
		However, KENIZEN reserves the right to review the log files if
		KENIZEN has reasonable cause to believe that the member is using
		KENIZEN Services and/or KENIZEN Websites in breach of contractual
		agreements or the applicable legislation. In doing this, KENIZEN is
		protecting other KENIZEN Members, the safety of KENIZEN Members’
		data, as well as KENIZEN Websites and the KENIZEN Services.</P>
		<P>The
		&quot;Mobile Handshake&quot; function allows you to see if there are
		KENIZEN Members in your vicinity who are also using this function. It
		allows other KENIZEN Members to find you if you have the &quot;Mobile
		Handshake&quot; function activated. To do this, KENIZEN needs to
		determine your location for a short period of time. In doing so,
		KENIZEN saves your position (longitude and latitude) and the point in
		time at which you used the &quot;Mobile Handshake&quot; function in
		its server log file. This information is only stored while KENIZEN
		determines your location. Once this process has been completed, your
		data will be deleted or anonymized.
		</P>

		of KENIZEN Services is reserved for persons who have reached the
		legal age of 18. Member below 18 years of age may be permitted in
